# Quick Tricks - [QT-1] - How to Extract Text and Images From a PDF

Starting today, I will unveil a "series" of posts called 'Sepp Quick Tricks' [SQT], with [SQT-1] being the debut challenge. In these posts, I will share agile and effective solutions for common programming challenges. We will explore best practices, useful tricks, and intelligent strategies to overcome the obstacles we encounter in our day-to-day development journey.

- Tool: Python 3.11.4

## What to Expect from [SQT]?

- In the inaugural edition of Sepp Quick Tricks, I have created and demonstrated a powerful solution to extract text and images from a PDF, in a simple and efficient manner.

## Uncomplicated Step-by-Step:

1) I used the 'fitz' library to extract text from the PDF, page by page, creating a single text file containing all the content.

2) I saved the extracted text in TXT and DOCX formats, expanding usage options.

3) Subsequently, I delved into the 'pikepdf' library to extract images from the PDF and saved them in a designated folder.

## Applications:

- Imagine the convenience of automating the extraction of PDF information in a professional setting? This solution has applications in various scenarios, from data collection in reports to optimizing the reading of scanned documents.

## Distinct from AI/ML Projects:

- [SQT] posts stand apart from the previously shared AI and Machine Learning projects. This "series" offers focused and concise solutions for common programming dilemmas, enriching your arsenal of practical knowledge.
